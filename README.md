# KCureve simple implementation in python
_A very simple and non-optimizal version of SIGGRAPH2017 paper [k-Curves: Interpolation at Local Maximum Curvature](http://s2017.siggraph.org/technical-papers/sessions/sketching-curves) python implementation,just for presentation_

## Origin Paper
[paper link](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/kcurves.pdf)

## REF
_some python libs used in this implementation_
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html)
- [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/)
- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/docs.html)

## TODO
_hope I can change it better in the coming months
- [ ]still need some optimization to make it fast,maybe some CPython extensions.
- [ ]haven't implemented cases where the ponits don't connect at last.
